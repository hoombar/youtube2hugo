  "blog_content_template": "# Troubleshooting zigbee networks\n\n## Section 1\n\nRight, so you want to know how to build a proper Zigbee network that actually works reliably,\n\nor maybe you're doing battle with your current existing mesh network.\n\nEither way, you're in the right place because today we're going to cover everything from\n\nthe absolute basics, like why your coordinates placement matters, all the way through to\n\nnumerating errors in your logs. We'll talk coordinators, routers versus end devices,\n\nchannel selection, interference, and yes, we'll even dive into log files which\n\noften people tend to ignore but they play a key role in diagnosing a shins and building a\n\nblock solid setup. So as the video goes on, topics are going to get progressively more advanced.\n\nLet's dive straight into the foundation, your coordinator. Now, I can't stress this enough.\n\nThe coordinators basically the brain of your entire Zigbee network.\n\nPick a rubbish one and you're going to be fighting connectivity issues for months.\n\nPick a good one and everything just works. Well, kind of. We'll get into that.\n\nSo when it comes to choosing a coordinator, do your research and I mean properly research it.\n\nDon't just grab the first USB stick you find on Amazon because it's cheap. Read reviews,\n\ncheck compatibility, look at the community forums. The few extra pounds that you spend here\n\nis going to save you weeks of frustration later. What I'm using right now is the SLZB 06M.\n\nI'll pop the link down in the description for that. It's actually not a USB stick.\n\nIt's a power over Ethernet coordinator and I absolutely love it. I would highly recommend them.\n\nIt's been absolutely rock solid for me and the range is fantastic but here's the thing. Even if\n\nyou've got the best coordinator in the world, placement matters more than you might think. We'll\n\ncover that a little bit more later on in the video. If you're using a USB coordinator and there's\n\nlots of people out there who are, you absolutely need to use a USB extension cable. Why? Because\n\nUSB 3 ports can cause electromagnetic interference through your Zigbee channel. This isn't some\n\ntheoretical problem either. It's actually real. There's a really good video that was demonstrated by\n\nthe people at Nabakaza who show that moving USB cable closer to a coordinator actually stops it\n\nfrom working. This is the sort of thing that will drive you absolutely mad, trying to figure out\n\n{{< image-placeholder >}}\n\n## Section 2\n\nfrom working. This is the sort of thing that will drive you absolutely mad, trying to figure out\n\nwhy your devices keep on dropping off line and it's going to be very erratic and difficult to\n\ntroubleshoot. So definitely make sure that you're using a shielded extension cable. A simple\n\nextension cable costs next to nothing and it can literally save your entire network. Get the\n\nUSB 3 ports and ideally somewhere central in your home. Think about your home's layout. Where\n\nare the devices actually going to be and what's going to be between them. A central location on\n\nthe ground floor might not help much if half of your devices are upstairs. In the middle of your\n\nhouse is surrounded by solid walls then considered at 2.4 gigahertz signals might not travel through them\n\nparticularly well. Now here's something that catches a lot of people out. Connecting directly to your\n\ncoordinator might seem fast and like a good idea but be aware there is a device limit on coordinators.\n\nYou should check the documentation exactly for what the device limit is on your coordinator.\n\nThis is generally okay when you're just starting out in your Zigbee network and you've got a handful\n\nof devices on them but if you get the bug and you end up with 80 devices on your network\n\nyou'll start to see problems. What you're ultimately aiming for is a mesh network. Right let's\n\ntalk about something that will save you massive headaches if you get it right from the start which\n\nis channel selection. Zigbee works on 2.4 gigahertz which is the same frequency as your Wi-Fi,\n\nyour microwave and half the electronics in your house. The key is finding the channel doesn't clash\n\nwith everything else. Use an app like Wi-Fi analyzer. Again there's a link down in the description to\n\ncheck what channels you're surrounding 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi they're using. You want to pick a Zigbee\n\nchannel that's far away from busy Wi-Fi channel as possible. Here's the critical bit. Make the\n\ndecision at the start. If you change your Zigbee channel later you'll have to repair every single\n\ndevice in your network and trust me you don't want to have to do that with 50 plus devices.\n\nNow let's get into the integrity of how the network actually works. You've got three types of\n\ndevices. You've got your coordinator which we've covered and you've also got routers and end\n\ndevices. Understanding the difference is crucial for a reliable network. Routers are typically\n\ndevices that have constant power so your smart plugs, your light switches, your smart bulbs.\n\nBe careful though because not all powered devices are routers. You should definitely check the\n\n{{< image-placeholder >}}\n\n## Section 3\n\nBe careful though because not all powered devices are routers. You should definitely check the\n\ndocumentation for that and it's a dangerous assumption to make that all powered devices will be\n\nrouters. Some manufacturers make mains powered devices that only act as end devices which is pretty\n\nuseless for building a strong mesh network. I got caught out here by buying some of the Eukara H1\n\nlight switches assuming that they would work as routers. End devices are your battery powered\n\nsensors like motion sensors, door sensors, temperature sensors, that kind of stuff. These little guys\n\ndon't route traffic like other devices. They just connect your network and send their data but they\n\nwon't route packets to other devices. Typically devices can connect to any router in range. Some\n\nbit can be quite picky about which routers they connect to though. If you try and pair your device\n\nin their final position that tends to help with the routing. Don't pair them next to your\n\ncoordinator and then move them across the house. They'll try and maintain the original connection\n\neven if there's a better route nearby. Now the mesh itself is where ZigBee gets really clever.\n\nZigBee devices form their mesh automatically. It sounds great and furry. There's something that\n\nmost people don't realise though. It takes time and I'm not just talking hours or even days but\n\nsome ZigBee networks can take weeks to establish themselves so that they're fully optimised.\n\nThis is probably the hardest part for most people because everyone wants things to work perfectly\n\nright away but your devices are constantly learning about each other and figuring out the best\n\nroutes and adapting changes in their environment. Patience is absolutely key here.\n\nSomething that may well save you hours of troubleshooting is knowing that some devices are\n\nwhat I call sticky so a car or devices in the tourist for this. They latch onto the first\n\nrouter they connect to and they're refused to jump to a better router even if the signal strength\n\nis terrible. That's why pairing in the final position for these kind of devices is especially\n\nimportant. Don't overload routers either. They have limits on how many devices they can handle\n\ntypically. The good news is you can actually pair and devices with specific routers if you know what\n\nyou're doing. I use ZigBee to MQTT and there's an option to open up pairing on the network for\n\nspecific devices so I highly encourage trying that out. Okay this is what separates the beginners from\n\nthe advanced users is deep diving into log files. Most people will tend to ignore their logs but\n\n{{< image-placeholder >}}\n\n## Section 4\n\nthe advanced users is deep diving into log files. Most people will tend to ignore their logs but\n\nthe logs are basically telling me a story about what's happening on your network and trust me once\n\nyou know how to read them troubleshooting becomes so much more easy. Okay so here we have the entire\n\ndatabase with all of the ZigBee devices in. We've got the configuration which will basically give us\n\na mapping of those ZigBee devices over to a friendly name and we have the log file which is where all\n\nthe fun things are happening. So if we look at the root error many to one failures and we look at\n\nthis as an example of one of the things that's going wrong. You can see it happens quite a lot\n\nthroughout the logs and this is one of the things that we wanted to dive into but there is all of\n\nthese log file instances and we don't really want to go through and manually figure out how often\n\nthis is happening. So what we're going to do is take the log file and we're going to use the\n\nID that we get from here and we're going to figure out from here what that ID is and that will tell us\n\nit's this particular manufacturing device or device with this manufacturing name it's going to give\n\nus an i-triple address and then we can use that i-triple address to look up in here what the\n\nfriendly name is so you can see here it's the snug LED Vance socket so we can map this error\n\nwhich happens a lot for this particular ID all the way back to the snug LED Vance socket. So I don't\n\nwant to do that manually so I'm going to use my friend Claude and here's what I made earlier.\n\nWhat I've done is I've uploaded a bunch of some of the old log files and the old configurations\n\nso you can see it before and after and I've taken basically this prompt and I've said using the old\n\nlogs the old configurations and the old database find this particular error and various other errors\n\nand then go through and basically do all of that mapping so we can figure out what it looks like.\n\nIt's going to go through and do its magic and we're basically going to get this artifact and it's\n\n{{< image-placeholder >}}\n\n## Section 5\n\nIt's going to go through and do its magic and we're basically going to get this artifact and it's\n\ngoing to tell us what the friendly name is the i-triple address and basically the errors and\n\nhow critical those errors are, how often they're occurring in the logs and stuff like that.\n\nSo you can leverage this quite easily to figure out what's going on with your network.\n\nI also used, I'll go back to my network, the newer version after I've basically gone through and\n\nfixed a bunch of my issues and I ran the same analysis and basically got a similar result\n\nbut you can see here the numbers are much lower. There's basically only some very very low\n\nseverity errors. Some of them were actually due to things like configuration timeouts and\n\nClaude's going to be very useful here and basically tell me this is basically not much an issue.\n\nIt's a fairly transient issue that happens during startup and it's going to tell me a few\n\nrecommendations and in conclusion the cleanup was highly successful, brilliant. So I'm still going\n\nto use the logs and I'm going to look through the logs to get some hints on what I might be looking\n\nfor and then I'm just going to use AI to help me enumerate those instances and figure out what needs to\n\nhappen next. Look, building a reliable Zigbee network isn't rocket science but it does require\n\na bit of patience and understanding on how these devices actually work together.\n\nStart with a coordinator, choose your channels carefully, understand the difference between\n\nrouters and end devices and most importantly, let them read your logs. Do this right and you'll\n\nhave a great network that's incredibly reliable, responsive and just works. Get it wrong and you'll\n\nbe constantly fighting connectivity issues and wondering why your smart home feels like a dumb\n\nhome.
